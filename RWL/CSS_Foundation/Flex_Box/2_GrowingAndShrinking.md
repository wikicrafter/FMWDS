In CSS Flexbox and Grid, the concepts of growing and shrinking refer to how space is distributed among flex or grid items.

Growing (flex-grow or grid-template-columns):
Definition: Specifies the ability of a flex or grid item to grow in size to fill available space relative to other items.
Values: A non-negative number representing the factor by which an item should grow compared to other items. Default is 0.

```
/* Example using flex-grow */
.flex-item {
  flex-grow: 1;
}


```

```
/* Example using grid-template-columns in Grid */
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* The middle column grows twice as much as others */
}


```


Shrinking (flex-shrink):
Definition: Specifies the ability of a flex item to shrink in size when the container is smaller than the combined size of its items.
Values: A non-negative number representing the factor by which an item should shrink compared to other items. Default is 1.

```
/* Example using flex-shrink */
.flex-item {
  flex-shrink: 0.5; /* The item shrinks half as much as others */
}


```

Example:
Consider a simple Flexbox layout:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <style>
    .flex-container {
      display: flex;
    }

    .flex-item {
      padding: 10px;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }

    /* Example using both flex-grow and flex-shrink */
    .flex-item-1 {
      flex-grow: 1;
      flex-shrink: 2;
    }

    .flex-item-2 {
      flex-grow: 2;
      flex-shrink: 1;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-item flex-item-1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item flex-item-2">Item 2</div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


```


In this example:
flex-item-1 and flex-item-2 have different flex-grow and flex-shrink values.
flex-item-1 will grow and shrink differently compared to flex-item-2 based on the specified factors.

 What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property (e.g., flex: 1 1 auto)?
 
 The shorthand flex property combines three individual properties:

flex-grow:
Definition: Specifies the ability of a flex item to grow relative to other items.
Example: flex-grow: 1;

flex-shrink:
Definition: Specifies the ability of a flex item to shrink relative to other items.
Example: flex-shrink: 1;

flex-basis:
Definition: Specifies the initial size of a flex item.
Example: flex-basis: auto;

Example of the shorthand flex property:
```
.flex-item {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}

```


___

What are the 3 defined values for the flex shorthand flex:auto?
T
he flex:auto shorthand sets the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties to their default values:

flex-grow:
Default: 0
flex-shrink:
Default: 1
flex-basis:
Default: auto

Example of the shorthand flex property with flex:auto:

```

.flex-item {
  flex: auto;
}

```

In this example, the flex item will grow (if there is extra space), shrink (if there is insufficient space), and its initial size will be determined by its content and properties, following the default behavior.
