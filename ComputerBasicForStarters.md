<p><strong>Open source vs closed source software:</strong> Open source software refers to software whose source code is openly available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute it. This encourages collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development. Examples of open source software include the Linux operating system and the Mozilla Firefox web browser.</p>

<p>Closed source software, also known as proprietary software, is software whose source code is not openly available. The company or individual that develops the software retains exclusive control over its code, distribution, and modifications. Users typically need a license to use and customize closed source software. Examples of closed source software include Microsoft Windows and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
