<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>What is a web server?</strong> A web server is a computer that stores and serves website content to users over the internet. It responds to requests from web browsers by sending back web pages and other resources. Example: Apache, Nginx.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the internet?</strong> The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and networks that allows information and data to be exchanged globally. It provides access to websites, services, and communication across the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is an IP address?</strong> An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to devices on a network. It identifies the device's location and enables communication over the internet. Example: 192.168.1.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is a router?</strong> A router is a networking device that directs data between different networks, such as connecting a home network to the internet. It manages data traffic and determines the best path for data to travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is an ISP?</strong> An ISP (Internet Service Provider) is a company that provides internet access to individuals and businesses. It offers services like internet connectivity, email, and web hosting.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?</strong> Packets are small units of data that are used to transmit information over networks. Data is divided into packets, each containing a part of the message along with addressing information. These packets are sent individually and reassembled at the destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is a client?</strong> A client is a computer or device that requests and receives information or services from a server. In the context of the internet, a web browser is a common example of a client.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>What is a web page?</strong> A web page is a document displayed in a web browser. It can contain text, images, links, and multimedia elements. Web pages make up websites and are accessed via URLs.</p>

<p><strong>What is a DNS request?</strong> A DNS (Domain Name System) request is a query sent by a computer to translate a human-readable domain name (e.g., google.com) into an IP address that computers can understand.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.</strong> When you search on Google, your query is sent to Google's servers. These servers use complex algorithms to search through their vast index of web pages, ranking relevant results. The results are then displayed on your screen, with the most relevant websites listed first.</p>
